# VueJS Coordinate Converter
This is my first VueJS-based program and still a work in progress. It can be used
to convert between the three coordinate systems. Simply type numbers in any box 
and hit 'Enter' on your keyboard to calculate the conversion. You can also copy
using the buttons provided, although not tested in all browsers currently.
